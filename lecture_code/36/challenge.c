//Change ONE character to fix this program to print 20 dashes. 

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a;
  int b = 20;
  for( a = 0; a < b; a-- )
    putchar('-');
  return 0;
}

//Actually there are THREE solutions (again, changing only ONE character). Find all three.

//Bonus: Change one character to print 21 dashes.
